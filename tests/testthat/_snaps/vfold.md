    Condition
      Warning:
      Stratifying groups that make up 1% of the data may be statistically risky.
      * Consider increasing `pool` to at least 0.1

# bad args

    `v` must be a single positive integer

---

    The number of rows is less than `v = 500`

---

    Repeated resampling when `v` is 150 would create identical resamples
