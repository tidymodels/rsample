## Overview

The rsample package provides functions to create different types of resamples and corresponding classes for their analysis. 
The goal is to have a modular set of methods that can be used for:
 
 * resampling for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic
 * estimating model performance using a holdout set
 
The scope of rsample is to provide the basic building blocks for creating and analyzing resamples of a data set, but this package does not include code for modeling or calculating statistics. The [Working with Resample Sets](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/articles/Working_with_rsets.html) vignette gives a demonstration of how rsample tools can be used when building models.  

Note that resampled data sets created by rsample are directly accessible in a resampling object but do not contain much overhead in memory. Since the original data is not modified, R does not make an automatic copy. 
 
For example, creating 50 bootstraps of a data set does not create an object that is 50-fold larger in memory:

``` r
library(rsample)
library(mlbench)

data(LetterRecognition)
lobstr::obj_size(LetterRecognition)
#> 2,644,640 B

set.seed(35222)
boots <- bootstraps(LetterRecognition, times = 50)
lobstr::obj_size(boots)
#> 6,686,776 B

# Object size per resample
lobstr::obj_size(boots)/nrow(boots)
#> 133,735.5 B

# Fold increase is <<< 50
as.numeric(lobstr::obj_size(boots)/lobstr::obj_size(LetterRecognition))
#> [1] 2.528426
```

<sup>Created on 2022-02-28 by the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) (v2.0.1)</sup>

The memory usage for 50 bootstrap samples is less than 3-fold more than the original data set.
